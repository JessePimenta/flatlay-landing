        <h2>What is Flatlay?</h2>
        <p>
          Flatlay moments happen every day.
You’ve likely to have created one and didn’t even know it.
Cruise your phone’s gallery reel or a friends Instagram page and your bound to find a neatly arranged shot of items laid out.  Whether packing for a trip, getting ready for the night or an epic meal – there’s just something about sharing those moments with others.

The Flatlay is a skill and when captured right has the ability to take you back to that moment. That moment before you left for the concert, packing for that breathtaking hike or prepping for that unforgettable anniversary dinner. Sharing those moments and the products that make it happen is something that others appreciate and ask for.

You see the questions and comments across your social channels all the time. Where did you get those shoes? How did you that shot? I cant believe you went scuba diving with sharks, what were you on and how do I get some? Ok, maybe your not an avid diver...

We at Flatlay are on a mission to empower everyone with the tools to help you share your recommendations and reward you for it.  We believe personal recommendations from someone you admire, follow or have personal ties to is the most accredited ways to find items you actually are interested in. A Flatlay is unique and a genuine way for you to find items you’re actually interested in based on the topics you follow. Our team has spent years perfecting this platform for the world and is excited to have you join us on this journey.
